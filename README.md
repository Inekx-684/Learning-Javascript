# Learning-Javascript
This is 1/3 repositories that i will use to lean github and in this case javascript.

This is the first repository that I use so i will be guiding my self with the Github documentation while I start learning Javascript.

this is my first branch commit
already deleted the branch :D

I have to mention that i've been using platzi to learn, and i found a course that will be usefull on this repository so i hope it helps.
